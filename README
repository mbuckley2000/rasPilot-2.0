This is a quadcopter pilot for the Raspberry Pi written in C++

The motor GPIO pins are set in Main.cpp, along with the PID constants

Features:
-Stabilises itself using PID controllers and the MPU6050's orientation data

WIP Features:
-Calculates it's position using an openCV library called arUco, the Pi's camera and the MPU6050's accelerometer
-Holds it's position using PID controllers
-Automatically tunes it's PID constants for more stable flight using hill-climbing algorithms

Requirements:
-Uses PigPIO to control the motors' ESCs through the Pi's GPIO. Make sure you have it installed and running as a daemon.
-Uses an MPU6050 Inertial Measurement Unit to determine the copter's orientation. Make sure you have I2C enabled on your Pi.

To Compile:
- git clone https://github.com/mbuckley2000/rasPilot-2.0/
- Set your motor GPIO pins and PID constants now in Main.cpp
- cd rasPilot-2.0
- make

To Run: sudo ./Main
